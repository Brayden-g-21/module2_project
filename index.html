                <h2>Why I Chose Software Development</h2>
                <p>
                Over the years of my life I have aquired many different skills and hobbies that all invlove critical thinking and creativity. I have grown to love music, math, writing, painting, and much more. However, I didn't have any specific specialty of mine, that I saw as an opportunity for turning into a career. Playing piano? It has been a fun hobby, but felt too unrealistic working out as a career.
                I considered going into architecture, and I took a couple classes for it but it felt like it was missing something important to make it a career that I could be passionate about. That is when I realized that I enjoy the combination of critical thinking with creativity. I love the idea of having a task to accomplish and finding creative ways to do it. I began to look into many different career options
                that involved strong use of those skills. Eventually a family friend of mine introduced me to the world of software development. Something that he was very passionate about, and enjoyed doing as a career. I began doing research on what software development is, and decided that it is a career path that I can be passionate about, and enjoy doing.

                <h2>My Experiences</h2>
                <p>
                I had chosen software development but where did I go from there? I tried out a few different online programs, but the way they were set up did not appeal to my style of learning. I also went back and forth between Python and Javascript, not being able to decide which language I should focus on first. I wanted to go to college to study software engineering, but I was unable to afford it, and I didn't live
                close enough to a college campus. Or so I thought. My sister began going to Tooele Technical College. I had never considered going to a trade school, but I began looking into what Tooele Tech had to offer and found their Software Development course. Seeing it as a good opportunity to learn, and gain the skills I need to get into the career field that I knew I wanted, I immediately signed up for the program. 
                I am using my current full time job as an opportunity to learn Software Development as well. I have a lot of free time at my job which works very well, being able to work on my education inside my current job, and in class. I am able to study almost every day for at least 8 hours a day. I am excited about what I am learning and I can't wait to see where it takes me.

                <h2>After Tooele Tech</h2>
                <p>
                    My end goal for the next few years is to have a full time career in Software Engineering, with potential for growth. I enjoy learning new skills, and developing my abilities on a daily basis. I want to put myself in a position where I can consistently improve every day. So after I finish the Tooele Tech program, I plan to find a job in the Software Development field, and return to a college campus. Whether
                     my job or schooling is full time or part time, I will be sure to find a way to put myself into a position to put the skills I have learned into practice, while also expanding those skills.
